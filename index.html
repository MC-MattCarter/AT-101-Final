        <p id="ZoneTalk">Zone 1 is classified as the "low intesity" zone which means that the effort should be relatively comfortable and you should be able to hold a conversation while running at this effort. The vast majority of miles should be run at this pace.</p>
        <p id="ZoneTalk">Zone 2 is classified as the "moderate intesity" zone which means that the effort should be more difficult and tiring and the runner should be working hard enough so that conversation is a lot more difficult. One example of training in zone 2 includes tempo runs which are longer efforts that are moderately slower than race pace. This zone should have the fewest miles run at this pace.</p>
        <p id="ZoneTalk">Zone 3 is classified as the "high intesity" zone which means that the effort should be quite difficult and not able to be sustained for a long period of time. It should be quite rigorous and conversation should essentially be not possible. One example of training in zone 3 includes interval training at goal race pace. This zone should have the second most miles run at this pace.</p>

    <!-- hmm I'm really not sure what the deal is with youtube, even the video that my teammate made specefically for the team is able to be embedded. Like quite literally race footage that my teammate got, no outside company to block it or anything I know it should not be blocked. In the future I'd would love to be able to embed videos without an error message. -->
